= Faye::WebSocket

This is a robust, general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
{Faye}[http://faye.jcoglan.com] project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Ruby.

Faye's WebSocket server can process {draft-75}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75],
{draft-76}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-76],
{hybi-07}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-07]
and later versions of the protocol. It selects protocol versions automatically
and presents the standard {WebSocket API}[http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/]
for you to program against. It supports both +text+ and +binary+ messages, and
automatically handles +ping+, +pong+, +close+ and fragmented messages.


== Writing a WebSocket server

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

    require 'faye/websocket'
    require 'rack'

    app = lambda do |env|
      if env['HTTP_UPGRADE']
        ws = Faye::WebSocket.new(env)

        ws.onmessage = lambda do |event|
          ws.send(event.data)
        end

        ws.onclose = lambda do |event|
          p [:close, event.code, event.reason]
          ws = nil
        end

        # Thin async response
        [-1, {}, []]

      else
        # Normal HTTP request
        [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ['Hello']]
      end
    end

    EM.run {
      thin = Rack::Handler.get('thin')
      thin.run(app, :Port => 9292)
    }


== Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text +ws+ protocol and the encrypted +wss+
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as hybi-08, though it's compatible
with servers speaking later versions of the protocol, at least up to version 17.

    require 'faye/websocket'

    ws = Faye::WebSocket::Client.new('ws://www.example.com/')

    ws.onopen = lambda do |event|
      p :open
      ws.send('Hello, world!')
    end

    ws.onmessage = lambda do |event|
      p event.data
    end

    ws.onclose = lambda do |event|
      p [:close, event.code, event.reason]
      ws = nil
    end


== WebSocket API

The WebSocket API consists of several event handlers and a method for sending
messages.

* <b><tt>onopen</tt></b> fires when the socket connection is established. Event
  has no attributes.
* <b><tt>onerror</tt></b> fires when the connection attempt fails. Event has no
  attributes.
* <b><tt>onmessage</tt></b> fires when the socket receives a message. Event has
  one attribute, <b><tt>data</tt></b>, which is either a +String+ (for text
  frames) or an +Array+ of byte-sized integers (for binary frames).
* <b><tt>onclose</tt></b> fires when either the client or the server closes the
  connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b><tt>code</tt></b> and
  <b><tt>reason</tt></b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the
  peer that closed the connection.
* <b><tt>send(message)</tt></b> accepts either a +String+ or an +Array+ of
  byte-sized integers and sends a text or binary message over the connection to
  the other peer.
* <b><tt>close(code, reason)</tt></b> closes the connection, sending the given
  status code and reason text, both of which are optional.
